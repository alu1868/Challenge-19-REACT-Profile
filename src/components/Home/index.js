                        <p>With my completion of the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp from the University of Texas, I have been equipped with relevant coding skills and mindset to pursue an unknown ocean of knowledge.</p>
                        <p>That means being ready for failure and learning from mistakes, nothing beats finding an issue and optimizing the solutions.</p>

                        <p>Being a team player means being a good communicator. I’m always dependable and ready to brainstorm ideas with others. Collaboration is the key to success and contributing to something bigger than yourself. </p>
                        <p>Being a good team member means resolving the problem, not the ego.</p>

                        <p>As an amateur film maker, I derive my influences from across the globe and am always looking for inspiration from every angle. </p>

                        <p>I’m always striving for self improvement, and looking for advice from outside my reach.</p>
