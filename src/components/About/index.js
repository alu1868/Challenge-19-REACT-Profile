                <p>Born and raised in the great city of Houston, I worked as an electrician under my father’s business serving the bustling local Chinese community. As demand and projects grew more complex, I began to utilize programs such as AutoCAD and Sketchup and began my journey into design. Eventually I landed a position as a designer and land surveyor at a solar company in Austin, retrofitting homes and businesses around central Texas for a more green future. Now I approach new challenges. Through the recommendation of friends I enrolled in the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp. Now equipped with fresh new skills, I’m ready to take on a new digital frontier.</p>
